MAPPINGS                                                     *treevial-mappings*

<CR>                                                 *treevial-cr* *treevial-<cr>*

  Pressing <CR> (return / enter) on your keyboard will perform a different
  action depending on the entry below the cursor.

  When the cursor is on the root directory (line 1), pressing <CR> will no-op.
  When on a file, pressing <CR> will open that file in the current window.
  When on a directory, pressing <CR> will toggle its state to open or closed.

<C-V>                                              *treevial-c-v* *treevial-<c-v>*

  Pressing <C-V> will not put you in |visual-block| mode. Instead, Treevial
  uses this key combination to open a file in a vertical split (|vsplit|).

  This mapping will no-op when on the root directory (line 1) or when trying
  to use this mapping on a directory.

<C-X>                                              *treevial-c-x* *treevial-<c-x>*

  Like <C-V>, but using a horizontal |split|.

<Tab>                                              *treevial-tab* *treevial-<tab>*

  Pressing <Tab> will mark or unmark the entry below the cursor. After
  marking the current entry, the cursor will be moved down one line. This is
  convenient for selecting a list of files in descending order.

  This mapping will no-op when on the root directory (line 1).

<S-Tab>                                        *treevial-s-tab* *treevial-<s-tab>*

  Like <Tab>, but moves up one line instead of down. This one is convenient
  for selecting a list of files in ascending order.

<u>                                                    *treevial-u* *treevial-<u>*

  Pressing <u> will unmark all marked entries.

<d>                                                    *treevial-d* *treevial-<d>*

  Pressing <d> will delete a file or directory (recursively!).

  This mapping will no-op when on the root directory (line 1).

  When no files / directories are marked, the entry below the cursor will be
  deleted after user confirmation.

  When one or more files / directories are marked, these files will be deleted
  after user confirmation.

<c>                                                    *treevial-c* *treevial-<c>*

  Pressing <c> will prompt the user using Vim's |input| prompt for a
  destination to create. When the destination ends in a '/' a directory
  will be created instead of a file.

  Any parent directories will be created as needed.

  Checks are performed before creating the destination file / directory.
  If destination exists, it will ask the user to overwrite or cancel.

<m>                                                    *treevial-m* *treevial-<m>*

  Pressing <m> will move a file or directory. The destination is requested
  using Vim's built-in |input| prompt with {completion} set to 'dir'.

  The destination does not have to exist, if it does not it will be created.

  This mapping will no-op when on the root directory (line 1).

  When no files / directories are marked, the entry below the cursor will be
  moved to a new location after user confirmation. This functionality can be
  used to rename files and directories as well. When renaming a directory,
  the final destination must end with a '/' character!

  When one or more  files / directories are marked, these will be moved
  after user confirmation.

  Some checks are also performed to ensure that moving one or more files /
  directories will not cause conflicts. This includes making sure that all
  the files to move (marked / cursor entry) have a unique filename. If
  this is not the case, the user will be asked if duplicates should
  be unmarked. This is done automatically.

  After this is done, the remaining files are checked against the
  destination if it exists, and if any files in the destination would be
  overwritten then the user has to confirm this or choose to unmark
  conflicting files and continue.

  Finally, checks will be performed to ensure that directories are not
  copied "into" themselves or would otherwise overwrite the directory
  they would be moved from, the user can choose to cancel or unmark
  and continue.
